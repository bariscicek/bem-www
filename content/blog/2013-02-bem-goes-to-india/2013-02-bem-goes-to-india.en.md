Meta Refresh is a conference on the construction of user experience on the web. It's one of the biggest frontend conference in South-East Asia that brought together more than 20 tech talks last year that were dedicated to practical experience of tools and technologies.

The 2013 edition is about letting go. Itâ€™s about learning the skills necessary to build experiences which cannot possibly exist in any medium apart from the internet. The conference is about to bring together professionals not only from South-East Asia but from Australia, USA, Switzerland. Conference will showcase people who have a deep understanding of what the internet is and what it can be: people who have built experiences and can tell you what they have learnt.

BEM-team will be among them. In her presentation Varya Stepanova will talk about our way of frontend development, how and for what reasons BEM was created, why BEM way of development, in our point of view, is the easiest and cheapest way, what are the benefits of BEM development.
